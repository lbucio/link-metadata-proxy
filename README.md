## Environment variables & pre-requisites

1. `SERVER_URL`: The URL where your server is runnning (used for serving static files). For example, if you are running the server locally it will be `localhost:3000` and if your server is live at `abc.xyz`, the value for this variable will be `abc.xyz`. This variable is necessary to serve static files correctly.
